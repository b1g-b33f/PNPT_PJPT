[[PEH_VM]](https://github.com/b1g-b33f/Study-Groups/blob/main/PEH_vm.ps1)
Just a little PowerShell script I made to start all the Active Directory VMs that you build in the Practical Ethical Hacking course from TCM Security without having to click start on each VM individually. If you used pimpmykali or followed the course material, your VM names should match so all you have to do is run with PowerShell and enjoy. **Works with VirtualBox only**.
